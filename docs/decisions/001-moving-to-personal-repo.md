# Moving To Personal Repo

Date: 2024-08-09

## Context

William provides a repo for you to follow along with while completing the course. This is great, but you have to pay a
subscription to have access to the repo and course content.

The repo provided in on an old version of expo, and I'd like to check out all the latest updates such as expo router and
the debugger.

## Decision

I only plan to pay the subscription for one month and I would like to this code forever. So I will be moving the code
over to a personal repo and upgrading it to the latest expo sdk version.

## Consequences

A little time is wasted in this process, but I haven't used expo in a while so this will give me a change to brush up on
it in the process.
